                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>An artist at heart. I've been creating things since I don't know when. Graduating with a bachelor's degree in Art Therapy, the art became my therapy. After moving to Arizona and working for the Phoenix Art Group, where I recreated other people's designs for buisnesses all over the world, I moved home and with great encouragement from my husband, sold my own art work with no middle man.</p>
                <p>I had a studio space in downtown Toldeo, but after the birth of my first child, time in the studio became short. After our second child was born, the studio was moved into our garage (behind the lawnmower) and after my third child was born, the art studio moved to our kitchen. It was at that time that I realized it was time to put away my giant clunky canvases and begin painting cookies.</p>
                <p>Hence, Cookie Canvas.</p>
                <p>God has given me the knowledge and skills to create beautiful and DELICIOUS custom cookies and He has given me incredible customers like you to keep me busy.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
                <p>Enjoy these cookies at your next special occasion or for no occasion at all. In a box, on a platter or individually wrapped.</p>
